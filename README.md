### Getting Started

This repository contains the standalone application detailed in the final chapter of [`RxJS In Action`](https://www.manning.com/books/rxjs-in-action). The intention of this repository is to show a fairly complete application, since the primary technology on display here is the use of RxJS + React + Redux (3R) and is meant to be accessible for a large audience. Therefore, we are not using JSX or any complex build systems. Entire books can and have been written on such things but unfortunately we don't have the page count for it :(.

Please report any issues you find with running or accessing the project, or any bugs that you find.

The core components that are discussed in the book will not be changed aside from periodic updates.

### Important
If you are looking for the repository for the first 9 chapters you should be in the sister respository [here](https://github.com/RxJSInAction/rxjs-in-action).
